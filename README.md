Welcome to my GitHub repository for "Invisibility using OpenCV"!

In this project, I explore the exciting world of computer vision using OpenCV and Python. The goal is to achieve the elusive feature of invisibility using image processing techniques.

I have created a demonstration video (link provided above) that showcases the capabilities of this project. Using a webcam and a green cloth as a background, I show how my code can make the cloth appear transparent, making objects behind it visible as if they were invisible.

The code is written in Python, making use of the powerful OpenCV library, which provides a rich set of image processing functions. I have also included detailed comments in the code to aid in understanding.

Feel free to download, use, and modify the code for your own projects. I hope you find this repository informative and useful!
